Chapter 4. The Road Through the Forest.

After a few hours, the road became rough, making walking difficult. The Scarecrow often tripped on the uneven yellow bricks.

Some bricks were broken or missing, creating holes that Toto jumped across and Dorothy walked around.

Since the Scarecrow had no brains, he walked straight ahead and stepped into the holes and tumbled down.

It never hurt him, so Dorothy picked him up and set him on his feet. They laughed together.

The farms here were not as well cared for as those they passed earlier.

There were fewer houses and fruit trees. The farther they walked, the more lonely and dreary the land became.

At noon, they sat by the roadside near a small creek. Dorothy opened her basket and took out some bread.

She offered a piece to the Scarecrow, but he refused.

"I am never hungry," he said. "It is lucky because my mouth is just painted on. If I cut a hole to eat, the straw inside me would fall out. That would ruin the shape of my head."

Dorothy saw this was true. She nodded and kept eating her bread.

"Tell me about yourself and the country you came from," said the Scarecrow after she finished eating.

Dorothy told him about Kansas, where everything was gray, and how the tornado brought her to this strange land of Oz.

The Scarecrow listened carefully and said, "I don't understand why you want to leave this beautiful place and return to that dry, gray land."

"That is because you have no brains," said Dorothy. "No matter how dull and gray our homes are, we people made of flesh would rather live there than anywhere else, no matter how beautiful. There is no place like home."

The Scarecrow sighed.

"Of course I don't understand," he said. "If your heads were stuffed with straw like mine, you would all live in beautiful places. Then Kansas would have no people at all. It's lucky for Kansas that you have brains."

"Will you tell me a story while we rest?" Dorothy asked.

The Scarecrow looked at her sadly and said,

"My life has been so short that I know nothing at all. I was only made the day before yesterday. Anything that happened before that is a mystery to me. Luckily, when the farmer made my head, he painted my ears first, so I could hear everything. 

Another Munchkin was with him, and the first thing I heard was the farmer saying, 'How do you like those ears?'"

"'They aren't straight,'" the other Munchkin said.

"'Never mind,'" said the farmer. "'They are still ears,'" which was true enough.

"'Now I'll make the eyes,'" the farmer said. He painted my right eye, and as soon as it was done, I looked at him and everything around me with great curiosity. It was my first glimpse of the world.

"'That's a rather pretty eye,'" said the Munchkin watching the farmer. "'Blue paint is the perfect color for eyes.'"

"'I think I'll make the other one a little bigger,'" said the farmer. When the second eye was finished, I could see much better. Then he made my nose and mouth. But I didn't speak, because I didn't know what a mouth was for.

I enjoyed watching them make my body, arms, and legs. When they finally attached my head, I felt very proud. I thought I was just as good as any man.

"'This fellow will scare the crows easily,'" said the farmer. "'He looks just like a man.'"

"'Well, he is a man,'" said the other, and I completely agreed.

The farmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield and set me on a tall stick, where you found me. Then he and his friend walked away, leaving me all alone.

"I didn't like being left alone, so I tried to walk after them. But my feet couldn’t reach the ground, and I had to stay on that pole.

"It was a lonely life because I had nothing to think about, having been made so recently. Many crows and other birds flew into the cornfield, but as soon as they saw me, they flew away. They thought I was a Munchkin. This pleased me and made me feel important.

"After a while, an old crow flew near, looked at me carefully, then landed on my shoulder. He said, 'Did that farmer really think he could fool me this easily? Any smart crow can see you're just stuffed with straw.'

Then he hopped down to my feet and ate as much corn as he wanted. When the other birds saw nothing happened to him, they came to eat too. Soon, a huge flock was gathered around me."

"I felt sad because it proved I wasn't a very good Scarecrow after all. But the old crow comforted me, saying, 'If you had brains, you would be as good as any man—and better than some. Brains are the only thing that truly matters, whether you're a crow or a man.'

"After the crows left, I thought about this and decided I would do my best to get some brains. Luckily, you came along and pulled me off the stake. From what you say, I’m sure the Great Oz will give me brains when we reach the Emerald City."

"I hope so," said Dorothy sincerely, "since you really seem to want them."

"Oh, yes, I do," said the Scarecrow. "It feels awful to know you're a fool."

"Well," said Dorothy, "let's go." She handed the basket to the Scarecrow.

There were no fences along the roadside now, and the land was rough and uncultivated.

By evening, they reached a great forest where the trees grew so large and close together that their branches met over the yellow brick road. It was almost dark beneath the trees because the thick branches blocked the daylight. But the travelers kept going and entered the forest.

"If this road goes in, it must come out," said the Scarecrow. "Since the Emerald City is at the other end, we have to follow wherever it leads."

"Anyone would know that," said Dorothy.

"Of course! That's why I know it," said the Scarecrow. "If it took brains to figure out, I never would have said it."

After about an hour, the light disappeared, and they stumbled through the darkness. Dorothy couldn’t see at all, but Toto could, since some dogs see well in the dark. The Scarecrow claimed he could see just as well as in daylight. So Dorothy held onto his arm and managed to walk without much trouble.

"If you see a house or any place where we can stay for the night," she said, "you must tell me. Walking in the dark is very uncomfortable."

Soon after, the Scarecrow stopped.

"I see a little cottage to our right," he said. "It's made of logs and branches. Should we go there?"

"Yes, definitely," said Dorothy. "I'm completely worn out."

The Scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the cottage. Dorothy went inside and found a bed of dried leaves in one corner. 

She lay down right away, and with Toto beside her, soon fell into a deep sleep. The Scarecrow, who never got tired, stood in another corner and waited patiently for morning.
