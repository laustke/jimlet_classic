Chapter 2. Meeting the Munchkins.

Dorothy woke up with a sudden, strong bump. If she hadn't been lying on a soft bed, she might have been hurt. The shock made her gasp, and she wondered what had happened. Toto pressed his cold nose against her face and whimpered sadly.

She sat up and realized the house had stopped moving. It was no longer dark inside. Bright sunlight streamed through the window, lighting up the small room. Dorothy jumped out of bed and ran to the door. With Toto right behind her, she pulled it open.

Dorothy gasped in amazement, her eyes growing wider and wider at the incredible sights around her.

The tornado had set the house down surprisingly gently in a land of breathtaking beauty. Green grass stretched in every direction, with tall trees full of ripe, delicious fruit.

Vibrant flowers bloomed everywhere, and colorful birds with dazzling feathers sang and flitted through the branches.

Not far away, a little creek sparkled as it rushed between grassy banks. Its soft, flowing sound was a welcome change for a little girl who had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies.

As she stood, eagerly watching the strange and beautiful sights, she saw a group approaching. They were the strangest people she had ever seen.

They were not as tall as the grown-ups she knew, but they were not very small either. In fact, they were about the same height as Dorothy, who was tall for her age. However, their faces looked much older than hers.

They wore round, peaked hats that rose a foot high, with small bells around the brims that tinkled softly.

The men's hats were blue, while the woman's hat was white. She wore a long white gown with folds at the shoulders. Little stars were scattered across her gown, sparkling in the sunlight like diamonds.

The men wore blue outfits that matched their hats and had well-polished boots with wide blue cuffs at the top.

Dorothy thought the men were about as old as Uncle Henry because two of them had beards.

The little woman seemed much older. Her face was wrinkled, her hair was nearly white, and she walked stiffly.

As the people approached the house where Dorothy stood in the doorway, they stopped and whispered together. They seemed afraid to come closer. But the little old woman stepped forward, bowed low, and spoke in a sweet voice.

"You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins. We are so grateful to you for destroying the Evil Witch of the East and freeing our people from her rule."

Dorothy was amazed. What did the little woman mean by calling her a sorceress? And how could she say Dorothy had killed the Evil Witch of the East?

Dorothy was just a kind, harmless girl who had been carried far from home by a tornado. She had never killed anything in her life.

But the little woman clearly expected an answer, so Dorothy hesitated before speaking.

"You are very kind, but there must be a mistake. I haven't killed anything."

"Your house did, anyway," the little old woman said with a laugh. "And that is the same thing. Look!"

She pointed to the corner of the house. "There are her feet, still sticking out from under a block of wood."

Dorothy looked and screamed. 

There, under the corner of the great beam supporting the house, two feet stuck out. A pair of silver shoes with pointed toes was on them.

"Oh no! Oh no!" Dorothy cried, clasping her hands in distress. "The house must have fallen on her! What should we do?"

"There is nothing to be done," the little woman said calmly.

"But who was she?" asked Dorothy.

"She was the Evil Witch of the East, as I said," the little woman replied. "She kept the Munchkins under her rule for many years, forcing them to work for her night and day. Now they are free and grateful to you."

"Who are the Munchkins?" Dorothy asked.

"They are the people who live in this land of the East, where the Evil Witch ruled."

"Are you a Munchkin?" asked Dorothy.

"No, but I am their friend. I live in the land of the North. When the Munchkins saw the Witch of the East was dead, they sent a messenger to me, and I came at once. I am the Witch of the North."

"Oh, my!" cried Dorothy. "Are you a real witch?"

"Yes, I am," the little woman replied. "But I am a good witch, and the people love me. I am not as powerful as the Evil Witch who ruled here, or I would have freed them myself."

"But I thought all witches were evil," said Dorothy, feeling a little afraid to face a real witch.

"Oh, no, that is a big mistake. There were only four witches in all the Land of Oz. Two of them, the ones in the North and the South, are good witches. 

I know this is true because I am one of them, and I cannot be wrong.

The witches of the East and the West were truly evil. But now that you have killed one, only one Evil Witch remains—the one in the West."

"But," said Dorothy after a moment of thought, "Aunt Em told me all the witches died many years ago."

"Who is Aunt Em?" asked the little old woman.

"She is my aunt who lives in Kansas, where I came from."

The Witch of the North lowered her head and stared at the ground, thinking for a moment. Then she looked up and said, "I do not know where Kansas is. I have never heard of that place before. But tell me, is it a modern country?"

"Yes, it is," Dorothy replied.

"Then that explains it. In modern countries, I believe there are no witches, wizards, sorceresses, or magicians.

"But the Land of Oz has never developed, because we are cut off from the rest of the world. That is why we still have witches and wizards here."

"Who are the wizards?" asked Dorothy.

"Oz himself is the Great Wizard," the Witch answered, lowering her voice to a whisper. "He is more powerful than all of us combined. He lives in the City of Emeralds."

Dorothy was about to ask another question, but just then, the Munchkins, who had been standing silently, gave a loud shout and pointed to the corner of the house where the Evil Witch had been lying.

"What is it?" asked the little old woman. She looked, then started to laugh.

The dead Witch’s feet had vanished completely, leaving only the silver shoes behind.

"She was so old," explained the Witch of the North, "that she dried up quickly in the sun. She’s gone for good. But the silver shoes are yours now."

She picked up the shoes, brushed the dust out, and handed them to Dorothy.

"The Witch of the East was proud of those silver shoes," said one of the Munchkins. "These shoes must be magical, but we never knew what power they have."

Dorothy carried the shoes into the house and set them on the table. Then she stepped outside again and said,

"I want to get back to my aunt and uncle. I know they must be worried about me. 

Can you help me find my way?"

The Munchkins and the Witch looked at each other, then at Dorothy, and shook their heads.

"To the East, not far from here," said one, "there is a great desert, and no one could survive crossing it."

"It is the same in the South," said another. "I have been there and seen it. The South is where the Quadlings live."

"I heard," said the third man, "that it is the same in the West. The Winkies live there, and the Evil Witch of the West rules them. If you go near her, she will make you her slave."

"The North is my home," said the old lady. "A great desert surrounds the Land of Oz, even at its edge. I'm afraid, my dear, you must stay with us."

Dorothy began to sob because she felt lonely among all these strange people. Seeing her tears, the kind-hearted Munchkins felt sad and quickly took out their handkerchiefs to cry with her.

The little old woman removed her cap and balanced its point on her nose. Then, in a solemn voice, she counted, "One, two, three."

At once, the cap changed into a slate, where big, white chalk letters appeared:

"LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS"

The little old woman took the slate from her nose. After reading the words, she asked, "Is your name Dorothy, my dear?"

"Yes," Dorothy answered, looking up and drying her tears.

"Then you must go to the City of Emeralds. Perhaps Oz will help you."

"Where is this city?" Dorothy asked.

"It is exactly in the center of the country," the old woman said. "Oz, the Great Wizard I told you about, rules there."

"Is he a good man?" Dorothy asked anxiously.

"He is a good Wizard," the woman replied. "Whether he is a man or not, I cannot say. I have never seen him."

"How can I get there?" Dorothy asked.

"You must walk. It is a long journey through a land that is sometimes beautiful and sometimes dark and dangerous. But I will use all the magic I know to keep you safe."

"Won't you come with me?" Dorothy pleaded. 

She had begun to see the little old woman as her only friend.

"No, I cannot," the woman replied.

"But I will give you my kiss, and no one dares harm someone kissed by the Witch of the North."

She stepped close to Dorothy and gently kissed her forehead. A round, shining mark appeared where her lips had touched, though Dorothy only noticed it later.

"The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick," said the Witch. "You cannot miss it. When you reach Oz, do not be afraid. Tell him your story and ask for help. Good-bye, my dear."

The three Munchkins bowed low and wished Dorothy a safe journey. Then, they walked away through the trees.

The Witch gave Dorothy a kind little nod, turned three times on her left heel, and vanished. 

Toto, surprised, barked loudly after she was gone. He had been too scared to make a sound while she was there.

But Dorothy, knowing she was a witch, had expected her to disappear like that. She was not surprised at all.
